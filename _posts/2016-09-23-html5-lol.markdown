I found 3 of my 1st semester ~1-week assignments, from 2012, and they still work! An engine, a pathfinding alg, and a renderer!
<br/>
These were later finished as teaching demos but unfortunately I left them on the uni website which is gone.

### 3. A js software renderer / rasterizer that I later upgraded in c++. Play it right here!

### 2. A* (A star) search pathfinding with diagonals, weights, obstacles, and a dynamic chase scene. Play it right here!

### 1. A 2d-platformer game engine from scratch, with unbreakableâ„¢ collision, procedural level, and crab bouncing. Play it right here! :P
