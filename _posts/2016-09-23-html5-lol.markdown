I found a couple of my 1st semester 1-week assignments, from 2012, and they still work!

### 1. A 2d-platformer game engine from scratch, with unbreakable™ collision, procedural level, and crab bouncing. Play it right here! :P

<br/>
<br/>
### 2. A* (A star) search pathfinding with diagonals, weights, obstacles, and a dynamic chase scene. Play it right here!
