This blog is sparse on writing; I blame it on doing and then also trying to life.

Here's a 2021 list of excellent dumb things that describe or rhyme with what I am:
* Proponent of egoless individuality, awareness, interestedness
* Computer scientist chaotic-pensively converging to the ground truth
* Confidence comes from deconstruction, understanding, doing. Not surface level shortcuts.
* Engineer of feeling, soul, style
* Indie director in some circumstances
* Business-principles-aware but impatiently so
* 50-50 logic & feelings fuelled storyteller
* My DnD character has a ton of charisma and a lot of situational debuffs to it
* Comfortable with complexity & n-dimensional space
* CEO of wise, loving, and benign disruption
* Hyperawareness, hyperfocus, hyperplayfulness is the opposite of being comfortably numb to the signal.
* Protopian futures lover, bitter optimist.

Check [my portfolio](https://www.deferredreality.com) for some projects and game-y things.

Some words about what I encourage, do, or appreciate:

> reason, humour, imagination, nerdiness, talent, equal poise, flexible mindset, exponentiality.

And Dunny krugs vs ego.

Here's what I like in gamedev:

* clear but high-bandwidth input, 
* [juicy feedback / visuals](https://twitter.com/martinpi/status/789392171791024128), 
* unique stimulus scapes,
* liberating mechanics, 
* emergent multiplayer shenanigans, 
* fanbase meta and/or para social engagement, 
* new ideas / approaches.
* game feel. mouth feel. (taste)
