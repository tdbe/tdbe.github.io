This blog is super out of date; I blame it on work and also trying to live.

Here's a 2021 list of excellent dumb things that describe or rhyme with what I am:
* Chaotic-pensive computer scientist
* Confidence comes from base principles understanding, & doing. Not surface level shortcuts.
* Engineer of soul & style
* Indie director depending on the mood
* Business-principles-aware but impatiently so
* Proponent of egoless individuality, awareness, interestedness
* 50-50 logic & feelings fueled storyteller
* My DnD character has a ton of charisma in short & specific circumstances
* Half hotblooded half coldblooded anime protagonist
* Comfortable with complexity & n-dimensional space
* Would-be CEO of something small & wisely disruptive
* Hyperawareness. - means you can get overwhelmed, but have a large & nuanced bandwidth
* Protopian futures lover; also pessimist futurist - those are the true optimists

Check [my portfolio](https://www.deferredreality.com) for some projects and game-y things.

This page has a few things about what I encourage, do, or appreciate.
	
Here are some cool words: 

> reason, humour, imagination, talent, equal poise, flexible mindset, exponential mindset.

also, I understand base principles of many types of human work dynamics, and the Dunning Krueger Effect. TL;DR It's like this:

Here's what I like:

* clear but high-bandwidth input, 
* [juicy feedback / visuals](https://twitter.com/martinpi/status/789392171791024128), 
* unique stimulus scapes through VR design 
* liberating mechanics, 
* emergent multiplayer shenanigans, 
* fanbase meta social engagement, 
* new ideas / approaches.
* game feel. mouth feel. (taste)
