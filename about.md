This blog is super out of date because, in short, time spent writing is time spent not doing. I've leveled up many times.

Here's a 2021 list of excellent dumb things that describe or rhyme with what I am:
* Chaotic-pensive computer scientist.
* Confidence comes from base principles understanding, and doing. Not surface level pretending.
* Engineer of soul & style.
* Indie director depending on the mood.
* Business-principles-aware but impatiently so.
* 50-50 logic and feelings fueled storyteller.
* My DnD character has a ton of charisma in short & specific circumstances.
* Comfortable with complexity and n-dimensional space.
* Proponent of egoless individuality, awareness, and interestedness.
* Half hotblooded half coldblooded anime protagonist.
* Would-be CEO of something small and wisely disruptive.
* Having hyper awareness. - means you're the opposite of not numb to social stimulus & subtlety.
* Protopian futures lover; also pessimist futurist - those are the true optimists.

Check [my portfolio](http://www.deferredreality.com) for some projects and game-y things.

This page has a few things about what I encourage, do, or appreciate.
	
Here are some cool words: 

> reason, humour, imagination, talent, equal poise, flexible mindset, exponential mindset.

also, I understand base principles of many types of human work dynamics, and the Dunning Krueger Effect. TL;DR It's like this:

* liberating mechanics, 
* emergent multiplayer shenanigans, 
* fanbase meta social engagement, 
* new ideas / approaches.
* game feel. mouth feel. (taste)
